Windows:-
Top of the hierarchy. It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy.

-> It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy 

->window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript
->The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

->Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) 
element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window. Each of these windows 
gets its own separate global object. window.window always refers to window, but window.parent
and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts. 
In addition to document and screen described below, window properties include

->setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer
->location giving the current URL
->history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history
->navigator describing the browser software

Documents:-
 Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
 ->Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page
 ->You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object

 ->document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML

 Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id. E.g., in the HTML snippet

<body>
  <p id="holyCow"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
</body>
the paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:

window.holyCow or window["holyCow"]
document.getElementById("holyCow")
document.querySelector("#holyCow")
document.body.firstChild
document.body.children[0]
